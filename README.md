General Assembly Front-End Web Development December 2014-March 2015

21-Dec-14: Homework #2: Included are two screenshots of a website for you to build. Do your best to mirror the very artistic design that I put together. HTML and CSS is all about attention to detail!
10-Dec-14: Homework #1: Take your resume (or any resume) and convert it to HTML. Focus on HTML tags and using the right tag to give each piece of content meaning. If you already know some CSS and want to use that as well feel free. Please submit either a single HTML file, or a zip file containing your code if you end up with multiple files.
