10-Dec-14: Homework #1: Take your resume (or any resume) and convert it to HTML. Focus on HTML tags and using the right tag to give each piece of content meaning. If you already know some CSS and want to use that as well feel free. Please submit either a single HTML file, or a zip file containing your code if you end up with multiple files.
