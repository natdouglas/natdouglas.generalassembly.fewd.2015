General Assembly Front-End Web Development December 2014-March 2015

06-Feb-15: Homework #11: 

22-Dec-14: Homework #3: Please study the following design (without looking at the source code) and try to recreate the page layout using HTML and CSS.  Focus on the sidebar column that’s fixed, and the scrollable grid in the content area.  All I’m looking for is the layout with colored boxes, you don’t have to do anything else graphics or design wise.  Also this site is responsive but again don’t worry about that, you can just pick a width and go with that - http://mainequarterly.com

21-Dec-14: Homework #2: Included are two screenshots of a website for you to build. Do your best to mirror the very artistic design that I put together. HTML and CSS is all about attention to detail!

10-Dec-14: Homework #1: Take your resume (or any resume) and convert it to HTML. Focus on HTML tags and using the right tag to give each piece of content meaning. If you already know some CSS and want to use that as well feel free. Please submit either a single HTML file, or a zip file containing your code if you end up with multiple files.
