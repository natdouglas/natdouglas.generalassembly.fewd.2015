// 1. Fill in the code for the following function

function summation(n) {
    // your code here to get sum of all numbers between 1 and n
}

summation(3); // 6
summation(10); // 55


// 2. Write a function to get the sum of all the even numbers between 1 and n (hint: use the summation function above as a starting point and look up something called the modulus operator as an easy way to get even or odd numbers)


// 3. Fill in the code for the following function

function firstWord(words) {
    // your code here to get the first word
}

firstWord(['red', 'blue', 'green']); // red


// 4. Fill in the code for the following function

function addDashes(words) {
    // your code here to combine all of the words with a dash between them
}

addDashes(['test1', 'test2', 'test3']); // 'test1-test2-test3'

// 5. Fill in the code for the following function

function countUpAndDown(n) {
    // your code here to count from 1 to n and then back down to 1
}

countUpAndDown(5); // 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1

// 6. Write a function that will tell you all of the words in the following array that contain the letter a (hint: you can use a function called indexOf() for this), so the answer would be ['cat', 'hamster', 'rabbit'] and if you want to create a new array you can use a function called push() to add items to an array

var words = ['cat', 'dog', 'mouse', 'hamster', 'rabbit', 'owl']; 


// 7. Fill in the code for the following function

function reverseString(string) {
    // your code here to reverse the characters in the string
}

reverseString('cat'); // tac


// 8. Based on our shopping list from class, write a function that takes this data structure as a parameter and gives you the total cost of the items in the list.


// 9. Based on our shopping list from class, write a function that tells you what the most expensive product is


// Use the following for questions 10 - 14

var Task = function(name, category, status) {
    this.name = name;
    this.category = category;
    this.status = status;
};

var Category = function(name) {
    this.name = name;
};

var Status = {
    open: 0,
    inProgress: 1,
    complete: 2
};

var tasks = [];
var categories = [];

// 10. Create two categories, each with a different name


// 11. Create two tasks, each one with a name, a category (which is a reference to one of the categories you created, and a status number which you can use the Status object for)


// 12. Add your categories and tasks to the arrays above using the push() function


// 13. Write some code that will loop through all of your tasks and write out the task name and category name for each


// 14. Write some code that will log all tasks that match a certain status


// 15. Based on what you know about HTML and JavaScript, write out a structure similar to what I did for categories and tasks to model the objects in a photo gallery. This is very open ended and there's not one right answer, so be creative!
